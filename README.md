Introduction:
In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has catalyzed a paradigm shift in healthcare, particularly in disease screening and management. AI, encompassing machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, offers unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize traditional approaches to healthcare delivery, particularly in the realm of disease screening. By leveraging vast amounts of data, AI algorithms can extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions, thereby enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of disease detection and diagnosis.

Disease screening plays a pivotal role in early detection, enabling timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. However, conventional screening methods often suffer from limitations such as variability in interpretation, resource-intensive processes, and reliance on subjective assessments. The integration of AI technologies addresses these challenges by automating and augmenting screening processes, leading to higher accuracy, consistency, and scalability.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the manifold applications of AI in disease screening and healthcare. It explores how AI-driven approaches have been employed across diverse medical domains, including oncology, cardiology, radiology, and infectious diseases, to improve screening accuracy, streamline workflow, and optimize resource allocation. By examining recent research findings, case studies, and technological advancements, this paper elucidates the transformative potential of AI in reshaping healthcare delivery and addressing critical challenges in disease prevention and management.

Furthermore, this paper discusses the implications of integrating AI into healthcare systems, including regulatory considerations, ethical dilemmas, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. While AI offers immense promise in revolutionizing disease screening, its widespread adoption necessitates careful navigation of privacy concerns, data security issues, and biases inherent in algorithmic decision-making. Moreover, ensuring equitable access to AI-enabled healthcare solutions and mitigating potential disparities are essential for realizing the full benefits of this transformative technology.

Through a synthesis of current literature and empirical evidence, this paper aims to provide insights into the evolving landscape of AI-powered disease screening and its implications for healthcare stakeholders. By critically examining the opportunities and challenges associated with AI integration, it seeks to inform future research directions, policy decisions, and clinical practices in harnessing the potential of AI to improve healthcare outcomes and enhance population health.
